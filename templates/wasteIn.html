        <h1>What is Waste ?</h1>

            Trash from our homes (domestic waste), wastes from workplaces, schools, and other public places (municipal wastes), and wastes from businesses and factories are all regarded to 
            be mostly solid wastes (industrial wastes).
        </p><br><br><br>
        
        <!--Sources of Waste-->
        <h1>Sources of Waste</h1>
        <p>Waste comes from four different sorts of sources: industrial, commercial, domestic, and agricultural.

        <h3>Industrial Waste</h3>
        <p>These are the byproducts of factories and businesses. The majority of companies pollute the environment by discharging their waste into rivers and the ocean.
            <br><b>Example:</b>  plastic, glass, etc.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Domestic Waste</h3>
        <p>Domestic wastes are the many waste products generated by daily household tasks like cooking, cleaning, etc.
            <br><b>Example:</b> leaves, vegetable peels, excreta, etc.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Agricultural Waste</h3>
        <p>Agriculture wastes include a variety of wastes created in the agricultural industry.
            <br><b>Example:</b>cattle waste, weed, husk, etc.<br><br>
        </p><br>

        <!--Types of Waste-->
        <h1>Types of Waste</h1>
        <p>Trash is frequently divided into two categories: biodegradable garbage and non-biodegradable waste. Here is an explanation of these two categories of waste:
        </p>

        <h3>Biodegradable waste</h3>
        <p>These are the leftovers from our kitchen, which also contain yard garbage and other rubbish. Moist waste is another name for biodegradable trash. This can produce manure when 
            composted. The length of time it takes for biodegradable garbage to break down depends on the substance.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-biodegradable waste</h3>
        <p>These are the wastes, which also comprise used paper products, shattered glass, plastics, etc. Dry waste is the term for non-biodegradable waste. Dry wastes are recyclable and 
            reusable.
             Non-biodegradable wastes are significant polluters since they cannot break down on their own.
        </p><br><br><br>

        <!--Decomposition of Biodegradable Waste-->
        <h2>Decomposition of Biodegradable Waste</h2>
        <p>Several mechanisms can assist biodegradeable trash break down and turn into organic stuff.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Composting</h3>
        <p>By burying garbage in compost pits, waste may be digested and transformed into organic matter in this manner. The wastes are created by bacterial and fungal activity.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Vermicomposting</h3>
        <p>With the aid of red worms, organic debris is broken down into productive manure using this technique. Vermicompost is the name for this manure.
        </p><br>

        <h3>Chemical waste</h3>
        <p>Chemical wastes are wastes manufactured from dangerous chemicals, most of which are created in huge industries. Chemical wastes might be harmful or not. Hazardous chemical waste 
            might be solid, liquid, or gaseous and will exhibit poisonous, corrosive, ignitable, and reactive qualities.
